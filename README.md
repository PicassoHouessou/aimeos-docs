# Aimeos documentation

Everyone is invited to improve the documentation! :-)

Just fork the repository (upper right corner of the page), edit and add files, commit your changes and create a pull request.

If you want to build the Aimeos documentation locally, you need Python (version 3) install a few packages:

```bash
pip install mkdocs material
```

Afterwards, run `mkdocs build` to generate the documentation. If you want to check the generated documentation in your browser, you can use `mkdocs serve` instead. Afterwards, you can have a look at the pages at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
